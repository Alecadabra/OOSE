Product Viewer -- Java, JavaFX
==============================

This is a simple JavaFX-based GUI application that shows a product listing, 
where products are arranged into groups. 

This project uses Gradle. In order to compile and run it, type:

[ On Linux ]
$ ./gradlew run

[ On Windows]
> gradlew run

(You *must* have Java version 11 or higher installed, but the Gradle script
will take care of everything else.)
