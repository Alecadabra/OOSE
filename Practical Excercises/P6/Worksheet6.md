# Worksheet 6: Dependencies

## Quesion 1 - Factories

### (a)

Run the file through various readers (Image reader, PDF reader, Markdown reader, etc.) and see which produces a result without error

### (b)

Have a static counter variable stored in the factory class that increments for every new SpaceObject created. As this number is under a certain threshold, only asteriods are created, as it is under a different greater threshold, asteriods and alien1s are created, and past the last threshold all SpaceObjects are created.

## Question 2 - Dependency Injection - Refactoring

### (a)

Before Dependency Injection Pattern:

```java
public class SecuritySystem implements SensorObserver
{
    private MotionSensor motionSensor;
    private HeatSensor heatSensor
    private Alarm alarm;
    private boolean armed;
    
    public SecuritySystem(Hardware hw)
    {
        SensorBundle sens = hw.getSensors();
        motionSensor = sens.getMotionSensor();
        heatSensor = sens.getHeatSensor();
        motionSensor.addSensorObserver(this);
        heatSensor.addSensorObserver(this);
        alarm = new Alarm();
        armed = false;
    }

    public void setArmed(boolean newArmed)
    {
        armed = newArmed;
        EmailSystem.sendMessage("Armed: " + newArmed);
    }

    @Override
    public void sensorDetection(Sensor s)
    {
        if(armed)
        {
            alarm.ring();
            EmailSystem.sendMessage("Sensor detection for " +
                s.toString());
        }
    }
}
```

After refactoring:

```java
public class SecuritySystem implements SensorObserver
{
    private SensorBundle sens;
    private MotionSensor motionSensor;
    private HeatSensor heatSensor;
    private Alarm alarm;
    private boolean armed;
    EmailSystem email;
    
    public SecuritySystem(SensorBundle sens, MotionSensor motionSensor,
        HeatSensor heatSensor, Alarm alarm, EmailSystem email)
    {
        this.sens = sens;
        this.motionSensor = motionSensor;
        this.heatSensor = heatSensor;
        this.alarm = alarm;
        this.armed = false;
        this.email = email;

        motionSensor.addSensorObserver(this);
        heatSensor.addSensorObserver(this);
    }

    public void setArmed(boolean newArmed)
    {
        this.armed = newArmed;
        this.email.sendMessage("Armed: " + newArmed);
    }

    @Override
    public void sensorDetection(Sensor s)
    {
        if(armed)
        {
            this.alarm.ring();
            this.email.sendMessage("Sensor detection for " +
                s.toString());
        }
    }
}
```

Other classes to refactor:

EmailSystem use non-static methods.

### (b)

Example of injector code:

```java
SecuritySystem sec;
Hardware hw = new Hardware(...);
SensorBundle sens = hw.getSensors();
MotionSensor motionSensor = sens.getMotionSensor();
HeatSensor heatSensor = sens.getHeatSensor();
Alarm alarm = new Alarm;
EmailSystem email = new EmailSystem(...);

sec = new SecuritySystem(sens, motionSensor, heatSensor, alarm, email);
```

## Question 3 - Dependency Injection â€“ Design

### (a)

1: A linked list of tabs, since deletion from any point is common and there shouldn't be too many tabs stored at once.

2: A shuffling array list for quick access when the user switches tabs, with an O(N) operation each time a tab is closed to shuffle elements down, which reduces to O(1) when removing from the end, which is more common.

### (b)

Self-explanatory unless I'm missing something

### (c)

```java
BrowserWindow win;
Tab t1, t2, t3;
UrlLoader loader;
NetworkConnection net;
HtmlDoc doc1, doc2;
Directory doc3;
Image i1, i2;
LinkedList<Tab> tabList = new LinkedList<>();
HashMap<..., Image> imgMap = new HashMap<>();

net = new NetworkConnection(...)
loader = new UrlLoader(net);
i1 = new Image(...);
i2 = new Image(...);
imgMap.add(..., i1);
imgMap.add(..., i2);
doc1 = new HtmlDoc(i1, i2, ...);
doc2 = new HtmlDoc(...);
doc3 = new Directory(...);
t1 = new Tab(doc1);
t2 = new Tab(doc2);
t3 = new Tab(doc3);
tabList.add(t1);
tabList.add(t2);
tabList.add(t3);
win = new BrowserWindow(tabList);
```
