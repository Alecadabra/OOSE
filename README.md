Object oriented design concepts, including polymorphism, design patterns, and
Unified Modelling Language. Topics include UML and its relationship to code, the Model-View-Controller architecture, separation of concerns, dependency
injection, and various other design patterns.

## Assignment

A long term coding assignment.

## Practical Excercises

Weekly unasessed assignments to demonstrate that week's course content. I don't
provide the worksheets that these are based on for copyright reasons so they
don't make a lot of sense without context.

## Take-Home Test

Week-long test/assignment that replaced a standard in-class test because of
COVID. Question booklet also not provided so the answers don't make a lot of
sense without context.
