Syllabus:

> Object oriented design concepts, including polymorphism, design patterns, and Unified Modelling Language. Topics include UML and its relationship to code, the Model-View-Controller architecture, separation of concerns, dependency injection, and various other design patterns.

## [Assignment](Assignment)

A long term assignment implementing a simplistic turn-based fighter game using good software engineering practices. Uses many design patterns and is very expandable and generic. See the UML inside for a good overview.

## [Practical Excercises](Practical%20Excercises)

Weekly unasessed assignments to demonstrate that week's course content. I don't
provide the worksheets that these are based on for copyright reasons so they
don't make a lot of sense without context.

## [Take-Home Test](Take-Home%20Test)

Week-long test/assignment that replaced a standard in-class test because of
COVID. Question booklet also not provided so the answers don't make a lot of
sense without context.

## [Take-Home Exam](Take-Home%20Exam)

Week-long test/assignment that replaced a standard final exam because of
COVID. Question booklet also not provided so the answers don't make a lot of
sense without context.
